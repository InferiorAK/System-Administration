## <center> Linux User Setup with Non-Interactive Shell

```
To accommodate the backup agent tool's specifications, the system admin team at xFusionCorp Industries requires the creation of a user with a non-interactive shell. Here's your task:

Create a user named ravi with a non-interactive shell on App Server 1.
```

---

- Login to App Server 1:
    ```apache
    ssh tony@stapp01
    ```
    pass: Ir0nM@n
- Create the user **ravi** with **nologin** shell:
    ```apache
    sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin ravi
    ```
- Verify the user:
    ```apache
    getent passwd ravi
    cat /etc/passwd | grep ravi
    id ravi
    ```
