## <center> File Permission Correction

```
After conducting a security audit within the Stratos DC, the Nautilus security team discovered misconfigured permissions on critical files. To address this, corrective actions are being taken by the production support team. Specifically, the file named /etc/hostname on Nautilus App 2 server requires adjustments to its Access Control Lists (ACLs) as follows:


1. The file's user owner and group owner should be set to root.

2. Others should possess read only permissions on the file.

3. User mark must not have any permissions on the file.

4. User jerome should be granted read only permission on the file.

    ```apache
    chown root:root /etc/hostname
    ```
- Read only permission of other:
    ```apache
    chmod o=r /etc/hostname
    ```
- No Permission to mark:
    ```apache
    setfacl -m u:mark:0 /etc/hostname
    ```
- Real only permission to jerome:
    ```apache
    setfacl -m u:jerome:r /etc/hostname
    ```
- Verify now:
    ```apache
    getfacl /etc/hostname
    ```
