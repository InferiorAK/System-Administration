## <center> Linux User Data Transfer

```
Due to an accidental data mix-up, user data was unintentionally mingled on Nautilus App Server 3 at the /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. To rectify this, specific user data needs to be filtered and relocated. Here are the details:


Locate all files (excluding directories) owned by user anita within the /home/usersdata directory on App Server 3. Copy these files while preserving the directory structure to the /news directory.

- Finding and Performing the action:
    ```apache
    find /home/usersdata -type f -user anita -exec cp --parents {} /news \; 2>/dev/null
    ```
    - `-type f` → Only files
    - `-user anita` → Owned by anita
    - `find /home/usersdata -type f -user anita` → locate all files owned by anita.  
    - `-exec cp --parents {} /news \;` → copy files while preserving directory structure.  
    - `--parents` tells cp to recreate the path inside `/news`.  
    - `2>/dev/null` → hide error messages like "Permission denied".
