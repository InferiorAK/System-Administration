## <center> Timezone Alignment

```
In the daily standup, it was noted that the timezone settings across the Nautilus Application Servers in the Stratos Datacenter are inconsistent with the local datacenter's timezone, currently set to Asia/Kuala_Lumpur.


Synchronize the timezone settings to match the local datacenter's timezone (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur).
```

My Oneshot solve:

```sh
for server in tony@stapp01 steve@stapp02 banner@stapp03;
    do ssh -t $server "sudo bash -c '\
    timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kuala_Lumpur
    timedatectl
    '"
done
```
