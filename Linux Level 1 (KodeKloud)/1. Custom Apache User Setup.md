## <center> Custom Apache User Setup

```
In response to heightened security concerns, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted for custom Apache users for their web applications. Each user is tailored specifically for an application, enhancing security measures. Your task is to create a custom Apache user according to the outlined specifications:

a. Create a user named anita on App server 2 within the Stratos Datacenter.
b. Assign a unique UID 1260 and designate the home directory as /var/www/anita.
```

- User Creation from the conditions:
    ```apache
    useradd -m -d /var/www/anita -s /usr/sbin/nologin -u 1260 anita
    ```
- Verify the user:
    ```apache
    cat /etc/passwd | grep anita
    getent passwd anita
    ```
