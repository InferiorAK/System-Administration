## <center> SElinux Installation and Configuration

```
Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter:


1. Install the required SELinux packages.

2. Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.

3. No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.

4. Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.
```
