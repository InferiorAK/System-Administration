## <center> Data Backup for Developer

```
Within the Stratos DC, the Nautilus storage server hosts a directory named /data, serving as a repository for various developers non-confidential data. Developer kareem has requested a copy of their data stored in /data/kareem. The System Admin team has provided the following steps to fulfill this request:


a. Create a compressed archive named kareem.tar.gz of the /data/kareem directory.

b. Transfer the archive to the /home directory on the Storage Server.
```
