## <center> Process Limit Adjustment

```
In the Stratos Datacenter, our Storage server is encountering performance degradation due to excessive processes held by the nfsuser user. To mitigate this issue, we need to enforce limitations on its maximum processes. Please set the maximum process limits as specified below:


a. Set the soft limit to 1027

b. Set the hard limit to 2027
```

- Login to Storage Server:
    ```apache
    ssh natasha@ststor01
    ```
    Bl@kW
- Check limits:
    ```apache
    ulimit -a
    cat /proc/$$/limits
    ```
- Edit limits configuration:
    ```apache
    vi /etc/security/limits.conf
    ```
    Or, This is cleaner than editing limits.conf directly:
    ```apache
    vi /etc/security/limits.d/nfsuser.conf
    ```
    ```yml
    nfsuser  soft    nproc   1027
    nfsuser  hard    nproc   2027
    ```
- Verify changes:
    ```apache
    sudo -u nfsuser ulimit -Su
    sudo -u nfsuser ulimit -Hu
    ```
    *Or, just check using logged in*
