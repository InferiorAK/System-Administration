## <center> Restrict Cron Access

```
In alignment with security compliance standards, the Nautilus project team has opted to impose restrictions on crontab access. Specifically, only designated users will be permitted to create or update cron jobs.


Configure crontab access on App Server 2 as follows: Allow crontab access to mark user while denying access to the eric user.
```
