## <center> Temporary User Setup with Expiry

```
As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named jim requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:


Create a user named jim on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2023-12-07, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.
```

- Login to the server:
    ```apache
    ssh tony@stapp01
    ```
    Ir0nM@n
- User creation:
    ```apache
    sudo useradd -m -d /home/jim -s /bin/bash -e 2023-12-07 jim
    ```
- Verify user and get the expiry info:
    ```apache
    getent passwd jim
    chage -l jim
    ```
